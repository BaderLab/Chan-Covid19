# Chan-Covid19
Code for Chan-Bader lab collaboration for Covid-19 research

README
--------
1. Clone the repo in your **user home directory** on the shared VM. e.g. to `/home/spai/software` and not `/home/software`. 
2. Each coding project create its own folder. (e.g. `<repo_root>/seqalign_blast`, `<repo_root>/seqalign_minimap2`, `<repo_root>/seqalign_clustal`)
2. Do work in a github `branch`. Develop your code in the branch. Merge to `master` (main code trunk) when done.
  * If you don't know how , please learn how to code with github branches. See this [tutorial](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches).
  * Talk to Shraddha if you have questions.
